                <h2>A Tetris Game in Assembly Language</h2>

                    The goal is to write a complete program in assembly language and run it on a NIOS II processor. In this project, a simplified 
                    version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">TETRIS</a> game is implemented in assembly language. You can 
                    play it on a Gecko4EPFL board.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The goal in TETRIS game is to arrange tetrominoes (this is how the game pieces in TETRIS are called)
                    to form continuous lines that span all the way from the left to the right edge of the game screen. Once
                    one such line is formed, it will disappear and the game score will be incremented. During the game, the
                    tetrominoes can be moved to the left or to the right (horizontally), or rotated, or simply let fall down.
                    Once the game screen becomes full and the new tetromino is no longer able to move down from the top
                    of the screen, the game ends. The longest one plays, the higher the score and thus better the outcome.
                    The figure below shows the Gecko4EPFL board and the role of the buttons. The game will be displayed on
                    the LED array of the Gecko4EPFL. Initially, the screen will be empty, the score will be zero, and the
                    first tetromino will be generated close to the top of the screen. Each LED represents one pixel, and each
                    tetromino, is made of 4 pixels. To make the game implementation simpler,
                    we only use the top 8 rows of the LED screen (96 LEDs in total). From the initial tetromino location,
                    you can move or rotate the tetromino, or let it fall until it reaches its final position. Then, the game will
                    generate a new random tetromino. Once you line up the tetrominoes to form a full line, the line will
                    be removed, and all tetrominoes stacked on the top of it will go down by one pixel precisely. One line
                    disappearing will result in the score being incremented (increased by 1 point). The game continues until
                    a newly created random tetromino canâ€™t fit the game screen.
